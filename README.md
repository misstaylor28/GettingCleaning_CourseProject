For this code to run, you will need to set your working directory to the UCI HAR Dataset folder that contains the train and test subfolders and the features.txt file.  

The program addresses the questions in Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project:
1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity       and each subject.
